tool used for simulating MANET is 
OMNET++

OMNeT++ is an object-oriented modular discrete event network simulator.An OMNeT++ model consists of hierarchically nested modules. The depth of module nesting is not limited,
which allows the user to reflect the logical structure of the actual system in the model structure. Modules
communicate through message passing. Messages can contain arbitrarily complex data structures. Modules
can send messages either directly to their destination or along a predefined path, through gates and
connections.

NED language:
The topology of a model is specified using the NED language. The NED language facilitates the modular
description of a network. This means that a network description may consist of a number of component
descriptions (channels, simple/compound module types). The channels, simple modules and compound
modules of one network description can be reused in another network description.
Files containing network descriptions generally have a .ned suffix. NED files can be loaded dynamically
into simulation programs, or translated into C++ by the NED compiler and linked into the simulation
executable.

INI File:
 Inital parameters for the network such as the mobility model for the network,playground size,routing protocol to be used
transmitting range of the nodes can be specified in this file.These parameters remains constant throughout the simulation
